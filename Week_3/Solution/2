1)

48 bit Ethernet Address: 00:d0:59:a9:3d:68

2)

48-bit destination address in the Ethernet frame: 00:06:25:da:af:73

3)

Type: IP 0x0800

4)

After 432 bits or 54 bytes, the G in getting appears.

5)

The Source address is 00:06:25:da:af:73. This address is the address of

my router/internet gateway address.

6)

The Destination address is 00:d0:59:a9:3d:68. This is the Ethernet

address of my computer.

7)

The two-byte frame type field is 0x0800. The bit that is valued to 1 says

to not fragment the set.
)
8)

The ASCII “O” appears 52 bytes from the start of the ethernet frame.

Again, there are 14 bytes of Ethernet frame, and then 20 bytes of IP

header followed by 20 bytes of TCP header before the HTTP data is

encountered.

9)
)
The Internet Address column contains the IP address, the Physical

Address column contains the MAC address, and the type indicates the

protocol type.

10)

The hex value for the source address is 00:d0:59:a9:3d:68. The hex

value for the destination address is ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff, the broadcast address.

11)

The hex value for the Ethernet Fram type field is 0x0806, for ARP.

12)

a) The ARP opcode field begins 20 bytes from the very beginning of the

Ethernet frame.

b) The hex value for opcode field withing the ARP-payload of the request

is 0x0001, for the request.

c) Yes, the ARP message contains the IP address 192.168.1.105 for the

sender.

d) The field “Target MAC address” is set to 00:00:00:00:00:00 to

question the machine whose corresponding IP address (192.168.1.1) is

being queried.

13)

a) The ARP opcode field begins 20 bytes from the very beginning of the

Ethernet frame.

b)The hex value for opcode field withing the ARP-payload of the request

is 0x0002, for the reply.

c) The answer to the earlier ARP request appears in the”Sender MAC

address” field, which contains the Ethernet address 00:06:25:da:af:73 for

the sender with IP address 192.168.1.1.

Abswer-14

The hex value for the source address is 00:06:25:da:af:73 and for the

destination is 00:d0:59:a9:3d:68.

15)

There is no reply in this trace because we are not at the machine that

sent the request. The ARP request is broadcast, but the ARP reply is sent

back directly to the sender’s Ethernet address.
