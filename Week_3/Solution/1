1)
Src: 192.168.1.102

2)
The protocol is 1 which refers to ICMP

3)
IP header has 20 bytes
Total length is 84 bytes.
Since ip header has 20 bytes, payload= 84-20 = 64 bytes

4)
The data is not fragmented since more fragment bit=0

5)
Time to live, Identification and checksum always change

6)
The fields that stay constant across the IP datagrams are:
• Version (since we are using IPv4 for all packets)
• header length (since these are ICMP packets)
• source IP (since we are sending from the same source)
• destination IP (since we are sending to the same dest)
• Differentiated Services (since all packets are ICMP they use the same Type of Service class)
• Upper Layer Protocol (since these are ICMP packets)
The fields that must stay constant are:
• Version (since we are using IPv4 for all packets)
• header length (since these are ICMP packets)
• source IP (since we are sending from the same source)
• destination IP (since we are sending to the same dest)
• Differentiated Services (since all packets are ICMP they use the same Type of Service class)
• Upper Layer Protocol (since these are ICMP packets)
The fields that must change are:
• Identification(IP packets must have different ids)
• Time to live (traceroute increments each subsequent packet)
• Header checksum (since header changes, so must checksum) 

7)
The identification field increases by 1 every time

8)
Identification field:0x00009d7c (40316)
TTL : 255

9)
No because fragment bit is 0

10)
No


11)

The second fragment is obvious because it now has a a fragment offset of 1480.

There are no more fragments because it no longer has a flag set for more fragments.

12)

Fragment offset, total length, more fragments bit, TTL and the checksum.
